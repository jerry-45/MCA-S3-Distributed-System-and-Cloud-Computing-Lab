| **Practical-03** | **Programs on Remote Method Invocation** |  |
| Practical-03-A | Retrieve time and date function from server to client. This program should display server date and time by implementing RMI. | ✅ |
| Practical-03-B | The client should provide the values of a & b. The server will solve the equation c = (a+b)^2 & c = (a+b)^3 and will give back the value of c. Implement using RMI. | ✅ |
| Practical-03-C | The client should provide the value of a, b & c. The server will solve the equation (ax2+bx+c=0) and will give back the value of x. If a=1, b=5 and c=6 then return value will be x=-2 or x=-3. | ✅ |
